# Elrikpiro's Advanced Task Manager

## Description

Elrikpiro's Advanced Task Manager is a tool designed to help users manage and automate their tasks efficiently. It integrates with Telegram to send notifications and updates about task statuses directly to your chat. This project aims to streamline task management and improve productivity by providing a user-friendly interface and robust automation features.

## Before starting

### Configure the config.json file
The first time the application is running it will ask you a few questions about your preferences:

#### App Mode

- **JSON file** : The application will save your tasks in a single JSON file, this is the most simple and easy to configure.
- **Markdown vault** : The application will scan a given directory and subdirectories for markdown files and query for tasks in them.
- **cmd** : Means that the application will interact with the user by using a command console.
- **telegram** : Means that the application will interact with the user by using a telegram bot. (Bot credentials should be provided)

Note: by now Markdown vault mode will only show tasks that have the following strings that start with '- [ ]' and contain '[track:: (category)]', '[start:: (date in YYYY-MM-DD format)]' and '[due:: (date in YYYY-MM-DD format)]'. It is projected to add some configurability on these matters to ease up it's use.

#### Data files directory

It will ask you for a directory to save your data files, uses the current directory by default.

#### Telegram credentials

If a telegram mode is selected, it will ask for a telegram bot token, if you don't know how, please check the section `Getting Ready>Obtain your bot token` from this site: https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial.

It will also ask you for a telegram chat Id, you can get it by following this tutorial: https://www.wikihow.com/Know-Chat-ID-on-Telegram-on-Android

#### Markdown vault directory

If a Markdown vault mode is selected, the application will need a directory (and subdirectory) to scan markdown (.md) files to. 

> [!note]
> Several markdown editors like Logseq or Obsidian allow users to create templates that combined with this functionability, would create a consistent TODO-list for tasks with any given periodicity.

#### Finally

A file called `config.json` will be created with a basic set of task categories/contexts, you can modify this file to reconfigure your task manager or delete it so the application will prompt you again on the next start.

## Usage (Python 3.11)

run `python backend.py` in the backend folder

## Usage (Win64 Binaries)

unzip the archive and double click the executable, a console window will open and apply the settings contained at config.json

## Usage (Docker)

### Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElrikPiro/advanced-task-manager.git
```

### Configure the compose.yaml
`TZ` should be replaced with your timezone. You can find a list of valid timezones [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

Edit the `compose.yaml` file to configure the application settings:

### Configure your config.json

Use the tutorial above or modify the example.
